# Texas Votes

Don't know where to vote? Don't know when to vote? Didn't even know there was an election coming up? We're trying to solve these problems. Official websites like [harrisvotes.com](http://www.harrisvotes.com/) provide valuable information to voters, but in many cases they're confusing to navigate and lots of information is stuck in PDF hell. We think we can improve the experience (and if you work on one of these sites, we'd love your help and feedback).
